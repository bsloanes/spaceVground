Uses Pyphot package to calcualte stellar spectra and colors. 
Goal of this research was to determine the disparity in spectra and color calculations between space-based and ground-based telescopy. 
Using open-source stellar flux density and error data:
1. Generate 1000 synthetic flux density calculations for each star analyzed with each a ground and two space-based telescopes. ~40 stars x 3 telescopes x 1000 synthetic files = 120,000 files.
2. Calculate spectra and colors using PyPhot.
3. Plot space-based against ground-based analysis.
